Results are based on telephone interviews conducted October 5-9, 2016 with a random sample of –1,017—
adults, aged 18+, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.  For results based on this sample of 
national adults, the margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.   

For results based on the sample of –520—national adults in Form A, the margin of sampling error is ±5 
percentage points. 

For results based on the sample of –497—national adults in Form B, the margins of sampling error is ±5 
percentage points. 

Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones and cellular phones, with interviews 
conducted in Spanish for respondents who are primarily Spanish-speaking. Each sample of national adults 
includes a minimum quota of 60% cell phone respondents and 40% landline respondents, with additional 
minimum quotas by region. Landline and cell phone telephone numbers are selected using random digit dial 
methods. Landline respondents are chosen at random within each household on the basis of which member has 
the next birthday. 

Samples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability, non-response, and double coverage of 
landline and cell users in the two sampling frames. They are also weighted to match the national demographics 
of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, population density, and phone status (cell phone-
only/landline only/both and cell phone mostly).  Demographic weighting targets are based on the March 2015 
Current Population Survey figures for the aged 18 and older U.S. population. Phone status targets are based on 
the July-December 2015 National Health Interview Survey.  Population density targets are based on the 2010 
census.  All reported margins of sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting.  

In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce 
error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.
